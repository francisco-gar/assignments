                        It was an exciting day for the guests of the acclaimed <u>Oprah Winfrey Show</u>. No sooner had they sat their butts in their seats but the guests were greeted by Oprah's, most favorite four syllable phrase. "<i>YOU GET A CAR, YOU GET A CAR, YOU GET A CAR. <strong> EVERYBODY GETS A CAR!</strong></i>" Pandamonium ensued as the crescendo of joyous, guttural screams permeated the live tv set. Tom Cruise himself could not contain his excitement and proceeded to jump up and down on Oprah's couch with what could only be described as deliberate and malicious excitement. Katie Holmes could not be found for comment but Mr. Cruise's publicist released a statment saying how much supports Katie and she's doing really well and couldn't be happier. Once the chaos of the car giveaway died down Ellen Degeneress, of the not acclaimed <u>Ellen Degeneress Show</u>, proceeded to start a dance off with herself. Eyewitnesses speaking off the record were only able to recount with horror how there were no winners to the dance off and simply being in the same room had scarred them for life. But Kevin Hart was there. So there was that. And the guests have to pay taxes on the <i>"free cars".</i>
